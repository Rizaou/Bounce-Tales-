* Unity's new Input System was enabled in this project. If you play this game on android devices, You'll see buttons on the screen. But you can play it on pc anyway.
* On pc, you can move the ball forward and backward using 'a' and 's' keys. Using 'space' key, bounce or swim the ball.
* There is only one level in the game.
* I created the models using Blender.
